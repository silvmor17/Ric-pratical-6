C.Perform testing of hypothesis using MANOVA.
MANOVA is the acronym for Multivariate Analysis of Variance. When analyzing data,
we may encounter situations where we have there multiple response variables
(dependent variables). In MANOVA there also some assumptions, like ANOVA. Before
performing MANOVA we have to check the following assumptions are satisfied or not.
• The samples, while drawing, should be independent of each other.
• The dependent variables are continuous in nature and the independent variables
are categorical.
• The dependent variables should follow a multivariate normal distribution.
• The population variance-covariance matrices of each group are same, i.e. groups
are homogeneous.
Code:
import pandas as pd
fromstatsmodels.multivariate.manova import MANOVA
df = pd.read_csv('iris.csv', index_col=0)
df.columns = df.columns.str.replace(".", "_")
df.head()
print('~~~~~~~~ Data Set ~~~~~~~~')
print(df)
maov = MANOVA.from_formula('Sepal_Length + Sepal_Width + \
Petal_Length + Petal_Width ~ Species', data=df)
print('~~~~~~~~ MANOVA Test Result ~~~~~~~~')
print(maov.mv_test())

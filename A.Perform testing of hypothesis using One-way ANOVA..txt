A.Perform testing of hypothesis using One-way ANOVA.
ANOVA Assumptions
• The dependent variable (SAT scores in our example) should be continuous.
• The independent variables (districts in our example) should be two or more
categorical groups.
• There must be different participants in each group with no participant being in
more than one group. In our case, each school cannot be in more than one
district.
• The dependent variable should be approximately normally distributed for each
category.
• Variances of each group are approximately equal.
From our data exploration, we can see that the average SAT scores are quite different
for each district. Since we have five different groups, we cannot use the t-test, use the
1-way ANOVA test anyway just to understand the concepts.
H0 - There are no significant differences between the groups' mean SAT scores.
µ1 = µ2 = µ3 = µ4 = µ5
H1 - There is a significant difference between the groups' mean SAT scores.
If there is at least one group with a significant difference with another group, the null
hypothesis will be rejected.

output :

Since theresulting pvalueis less than 0.05. The null hypothesis is rejected and conclude
that there is a significant difference between the SAT scores for each district.

H0 - There are no significant differences between the Subject’s mean SAT scores.
